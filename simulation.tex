\paragraph{Gridscapes}
A real-world landscape is a complex mosaic of common, rare and interacting land cover types with varying extents.  To facilitate illustration and interpretation we simulate simplified landscapes that we call gridscapes. A grid-scape is represented by 40 x 40 land cover units, or land parcels and each land parcel represents 100x100 pixels. A land parcel can be assigned to one of sixteen land cover types.  

\paragraph{Simulating satellite image}
Surface reflectance data are simulated for nine Sentinel-2 bands (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12).   Simulations are designed to represent seasonal modes (winter, spring, summer and autumn) giving 36 spectral bands per pixel and replicate band selection used to produce UKCEH land cover maps for 2017,2018 and 2019 (give link??).  Expected reflectance per land cover type is determined by taking a 100x100km tile from the UKCEH land cover map for 2019 and intersecting this with modal per season surface reflectance generated by the Google Earth Engine.  Table * gives the expected reflectance per band for sixteen land cover types. Please note that simulating reflectance in this way greatly simplifies reality as UKCEH land cover types typically represent multi-modal reflectance distributions.

\paragraph{Training and Classification}.  A land cover classification requires a set of labelled training observations. Each land cover block contains 10,000 land parcels.  A proportion of land parcels are selected as training observations.  This proportion is varied from 1\% to 30\% to explore the effect of training volume on accuracy.  For each land parcel designated for training all underling pixels from the simulated data are put into a labelled bag.  From this bag 10000 pixels are selected at random with replacement.  Strictly speaking this bagging approach is not necessary here as land cover types have an equal area in grid-scape, but in real-world this is not upheld.  

In the real-world random sampling with replacement will ensure that training
